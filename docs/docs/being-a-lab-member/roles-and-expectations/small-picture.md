## Life in the lab 

There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to keep the lab running smoothly.

* If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you need it, and also because others don’t need to get sick. If you’re sick, reschedule your meetings and participants for the day (or the next couple of days) as soon as you can. See a doctor and follow the procedure to report sick leave (see [Time management](../../how-we-do-things/time-management/) page). 

* By default, you are expected to the lab at the normal working hours every working day. You do not have to be in 9:30am-5:30pm every day but do show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done. Show up to your meetings, show up to run your participants, and show up to lab meetings. Show up for your work, and show up for each other too.

* You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night.

* If you're not in the lab any given day, you'll be assumed to be in one of four possible "states": (1) in annual leave/holiday, (2) in sick leave (or, by extension maternity/paternity leave or compassionate absence), (3) in official travel (mission), or (4) in official remote-work (teletravail). In all instances, you are expected to report which is the case, both to your PI (typically with a DM on Slack) and using your employer's absence reporting system. (see [Time management](../../how-we-do-things/time-management/) page).

* Make sure the door to the lab (both main lab and EEG lab) is locked if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you’re the last one leaving for the day. 

* Keep the lab tidy. Eating in lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.

* Dress code is casual but not too casual. When interacting with participants or presenting your work, don’t wear pajamas and sweat pants – but jeans are totally fine.

* Be on time. Especially when you are running participants – in fact, show up 15-20 minutes early to set everything up. And be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable.

* Be a good lab citizen: donate a little time to fix things if you think things are broken. Update this manual whenever you learn about how to do a certain procedure (ex. admin), and the information for doing it is either not in the manual, or the info there did not help.
