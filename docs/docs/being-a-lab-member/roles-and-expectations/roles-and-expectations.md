# PhD Students, Postdocs and PIs

The goal of this section of the manual is to clarify our roles and expectations. We are an interdisciplinary, multicultural group with a big variety of backgrounds and academic experience, and it is sometimes unclear what is generally expected of a member in a lab such as ours, as well as what one can expect from the PI. 

## PhD Students

As a PhD student in the group, you will be expected to:

* Know the literature related to your topic like the back of your hand. Stay up to date on the latest research, by using RSS feeds and/or getting journal table of contents. Also consider following scientists in the field on Twitter, BlueSky or other networks. 
* By the second-year of PhD, you are expected to know _more_ about your specific topic than your PI (more about the algorithms, about your data and results, about the people who work in the field, etc.)
* Develop your dissertation research. Typically, your dissertation should have at least 3 substantial experiments that answer a big-picture question that you have.
* Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences
* Think about what you want for your career (academia – research or teaching, industry, science writing, something else), and talk to your PI about it to make sure you’re getting the training you need for that career.
* Make sure you meet all departmental deadlines (e.g., for comité de suivi individuel de thèse) -- and make sure your PI is aware of them!
* Prioritize time for research. TAing or science communication are important, but ultimately your research gets you your PhD and prepares you for the next stage of your career.
* By the time you’re done, you will have to know how to do statistics and plots in Python, to use tools like _pandas_, _seaborn_, _pingouin_ or _pymer_ proficiently, to share your work with others using _git_/_github_, to write an experiment using _psychopy_, to make figures and posters using _powerpoint_/_illustrator_ or similar graphic programs. The learning curve can be a little steep on these but it’s well worth it. (If these aren’t compatible with your goals or interests, the lab is probably not a good fit for you!)

## Post-Docs

All of the above, and you will also be expected to move towards being more PI-like, i.e. to:

* Cultivate an independent research program (while still supporting the lab’s research)
* Help train and mentor students in the lab (both undergraduate and graduate) when they need it – either because they ask, or because I ask you to
* Present your work at departmental events, at other labs (if invited), and at conferences
* Apply for jobs (academic or otherwise) when you’re ready. If you think you’d like to leave academia, that’s completely ok – but you should still treat your post-doc seriously, and talk to your PI about how to best train for a job outside academia
* Challenge your PI when he/she’s wrong or when your opinion is different, and treat the rest of the lab to your unique expertise

## Principal Investigator

All of the above, and you can expect your PI to :

* Have a vision of where the lab is going.
* Care for your emotional and physical well-being, and prioritize that above all else
* Make the time to meet with you regularly, read through your manuscripts, and talk about science.
* Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and letting you attend conferences as often as finances permit
* Seek out research funding to keep our activities viable
* Obsess a little about your Python code, your open-science practices and the graphic design of your figures
