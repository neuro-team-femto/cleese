# Printing

## Printing A4-size in the lab 

Printing on the AS2M-PHOTOCOP2 printer needs a personal access code, which you should request at SCI via a [tickets.femto-st.fr](tickets.femto-st.fr). 

When you have a code, you can either print directly on the printer (dial your code), or install the printer remotely on your computer (instructions in [this pdf file](../../downloads/install_printer.pdf)). 

## No more paper ? 

There are spare packs of printing paper in the "Archives" room, which you can access with your room key. The archive room is located in the AS2M Dept. on the mezzanine, floor 1 (same floor as Estelle & Isabelle), right-hand side when looking at the double staircase (same side as cafetaria).

## Printing posters for conferences

### Printing using university services

If your poster is ready at least 3-4 days before your departure, you can use the University printing services ([Imprimerie UFC](https://www.univ-fcomte.fr/les-services-administratifs/imprimerie)]). Download the order form [here](../../downloads/Formulaire_Imprimerie_UFC.pdf), fill in with details (ex. 1 A0 poster on textile), and send it along your poster pdf file at [imprimerie.ufc@univ-fcomte.fr](mailto:imprimerie.ufc@univ-fcomte.fr) and/or [suzy.nicot@univ-fcomte.fr](mailto:suzy.nicot@univ-fcomte.fr). 

To that email, cc. our Dept. admins Isabelle and/or Estelle to let them know if the upcoming invoice and tell them on what credits this should be charged (ask your PI). 

Printing typically takes 2-3 days; in case of emergency, same-day printing can often be arranged but please contact the staff at Imprimerie directly to make sure it's possible (Suzy Nicot: 03.81.66.55.19)

### Printing on conference site 

If you're a bit late, or don't want to carry on a poster while traveling, it is also possible to print onsite. 

If traveling in France, the best is to locate a copy shop close to the conference venue (e.g. COREP usually has shops close to major university campuses), call them to make sure they can print in time, and ask them if they allow paying by purchase order (_Bon de Commande_). Then ask a quote (_devis_) with company details (address, SIRET, etc.) and ask our Dept. admins to issue a PO. On pick-up, simply hand over the PO in exchange for your poster, and you don't have to advance any money. 

If the printing company doesn't allow POs, or you're printing abroad, ask our Dept. admins how to best proceed. 


!!! note "Important reminder about posters"

    When preparing posters, it is often a requirement to include logos of the institutions funding the work (this may be a Fundation, a governmental agency, etc.). A lacking funder's logo can be used as evidence by this funder that the corresponding presentation was not project-related, and could mean your trip and conference registration cannot be covered on that budget line - creating financing issues down the line. A typical funder acknowledgement should include a high-quality vector-graphic version of the logo (ex. [Fondation pour l'Audition](https://www.fondationpourlaudition.org/themes/custom/customer/images/logos/logo-fpa.png)) and a statement such as _"Project funded by AAP Laboratoire DASHES (FPA RD-2021-12)"_).
