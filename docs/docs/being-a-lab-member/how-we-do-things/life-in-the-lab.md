# Life in the lab

* Make sure the door to the lab is locked if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you’re the last one leaving for the day.
* Keep the lab tidy. Eating in lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.
* Dress code is casual (and you can dress up if you want!) but not _too_ casual. When interacting with participants or presenting your work, don’t wear pajamas and sweat pants – but jeans are totally fine.
* Be on time. Especially when you are running participants – in fact, show up 15-20 minutes early to set everything up. And be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable.
