# Presenting at Café Neuro


As of Nov. 2023, every Wednesday morning (10am-11am CET), we get together (mix of virtual and in-person) for coffee, cake and a short talk. On a rotating basis, each member of the lab gives a small progress report: what they’ve been working on in the past 1-2 months, what their current data and results are, what pending questions they may have.

## Preparing your "progress report"

After some trial and error, we've converged to the following template for giving progress reports at café-neuro. 

Progress reports should be between 4-6 slides maximum :

1. Slide 1: a **one-slide summary of what happened previously**. This is just a refresher: _"last time I presented, I showed you how I wanted to do X; we've collected Y, and analysed Z, and this is were we are now."_

	!!! warning
		Doing this within one single slide is hard, but resist the tentation of spilling over several slides. Learning how to synthesize what you had been doing in one short "elevator talk" is precisely the purpose of the exercise. Think of the "previously, on ..." edit at the beginning of a TV series episode: it's edited down to the shortest possible length: that's what you should aim for. 

2. Slide 2: a **one-slide description of what problem you have been working on** in the past month or so (i.e. since your last progress report): precisely what you're trying to do, and why does it matter for the project

	!!! warning
		Again, one single slide and, yes, we know it's hard. Try to articulate exactly what is your current problem at the scale of the last month of work or so. If you can't synthesize it to a single (possibly busy) slide, it's likely that you have lost purpose a little bit. Preparing your report is also the opportunity for you to refocus and think about the bigger picture of what you're currently doing. 

3. Slide 3,4,5: one, two or (maximum) three slides describing **things you have learned in the past month while working on this problem**. One thing per one slide. This doesn't need to be BIG things, but this needs to be solid facts - things that you have spent sufficient time testing/thinking about, and now you're quite certain that these are facts. This is where you show us data, graphs or stats if you have some. 

	!!! hint
		You've learned more than 3 things ? Good for you ! Select the ones that you judge most important, i.e. that were breakthroughs in your understanding of the problem. You may also want to prioritize anything you've learned in the past month that's likely to be a little counter-intuitive, and which can be useful to other people in their own work. 

	!!! warning
		Only present things which you consider stock now, i.e. you've spent a reasonable amount of time testing/understanding. If it's not an established fact, then it's a "current problem" that's candidate for slide 6, rather than for slides 3,4,5. 

4. Slide 6: one slide on **what is your biggest problem now that you've done/learned all that**: describe why it's a problem, what you're doing or considering to do to break it. Try to explain the problem the best you can so people can give you feedback/ideas. 

	!!! hint 
		This (Slide #6) could be your slide #2 when you present next time.

## Attending Café neuro

The style is informal, the content work-in-progress, and the goal is to get everybody’s feedback, to keep everyone up-to-date about what each other is doing and to encourage cross-talk. 

At least one question is greatly encouraged, if not mandatory, from everyone in the audience - if you feel you haven't understood anything to a person's report, say so and ask for clarification, as it's likely what was lost on you was also lost on others. 

Ideally, each talk should be the basis for a further conversation between the speaker and at least one other lab member who may have something concrete to contribute (ideas, code, paper) to their project. 

Occasionally, we may also use the café-neuro slot for invited presentations by external speakers (although we rather like external speakers to take part in progress reports, so we can pick their brain :), for introduction presentation by new members, or rehearsing important upcoming talks such as PhD defenses.

## Cake ! 

If possible, we try to have a small bite and coffee to share while listening to the talk. Please consider stopping by the local bakery on your way to bring something when you attend.

## Archives

For the record, in previous installments of café neuro (2021-2022), we used a slightly different format inspired by [Kording lab’s “Lab Teachings”](https://kordinglab.com/presentations/), where each member of the lab speaks and teaches about something they know. Click [here](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/2022/11/09/Archive_cafe_neuro.html) for archives of previous topics. However, as the lab grew in size, we felt the need to absolutely keep the coffee and cake (!), but use a more traditional ‘project update’ format.
