# Travel 

As members of the lab, you may be given the opportunity to travel to e.g. academic conferences or other events. 

## General rule

If you are an employee in the academic sector (typically with us, if you have a work contract from CNRS, or perhaps one of the lab's other [tutelles](../../about-the-lab/about-our-operating-institutions)): 

1. you need to have a pre-established "ordre de mission" (OM) before you travel. Recall that, like sophisticated electrons, civil servants are in [one of five possible states](../time-management/) (in the lab, in holiday, on sick leave, in _teletravail_ or... on travel), and that each of the four later states have to be reported in advance (first to your PI, then using CNRS tools, see below)

2. you should never advance your own travel costs (e.g. buy a train ticket, pay reservation for hotel, pay conference registration), otherwise we will not be able to reimburse you. 

!!! warning "Read again"
	You should NEVER advance your own travel costs, otherwise we won't be able to reimburse you. This is also true if we have academic guests, especially from abroad: make sure they know this fact as early as possible when discussing a possible visit. 

3. instead, all travel reservations have to be made using the official CNRS plateform, which also automatically issues your "ordre de mission". 

!!! note "What counts as a mission ?"
	A "mission" is work related travel that takes you either from (A) your work place (Besançon, called _résidence administrative_) or (B) your living place (which may be Besançon, but also another city if you e.g. live in Paris and commute; called _résidence personnelle__) to another place (C). You can go from A -> C -> A, A -> C -> B, B -> C -> A, B -> C -> B, but not from A -> B or B -> A (i.e. CNRS will not fund your commute from home to work, however far away that is).  

## How to decide whether you should travel

Because your travel consumes lab budget (typically, competitive funding that's been obtained by your PI), you should seek permission from your PI for every work-related travel that you would like to do. If you are a junior academic (e.g. PhD student), your PI will typically suggest themselves that you e.g. attend a given conference, based on various criteria (it's in the field, it's a good time for you to showcase your work, other lab members are going, etc.). As you grow more experienced, you may (or, in fact, will be [expected to](../../roles-and-expectations/#post-docs)) identify your own travel opportunities (e.g. "that summer school looks really interesting"). Always ask your PI, but ask them as often as you like ! 


## CNRS Plateform 

As of Aug. 2023, all our travel arrangements should be made using a series of CNRS tools, Etamine, Notilus and Goelett. 

!!! note
	The following is only for people who travel on CNRS budget (regardless of whether you are a CNRS employee or not). This is normally the rule for most of our travel, as we in the lab try to have the majority of our budget handled by CNRS (see [this](../../../about-the-lab/about-our-operating-institutions/#getting-stuff-done-in-UMRs) for details about how UMRs work). If you travel on budget managed at another tutelles, ask your PI or our Dept admin about how to proceed.

In a nutshell: 

1. Etamine ([https://etamine-connecte.cnrs.fr](https://etamine-connecte.cnrs.fr)) is your starting place. Go there to declare your upcoming _mission_ (where you're going, why, what exact dates, what type of transportation, and an estimated cost). 

!!! warning
	The first time you use Etamine, you need to create an account and synchronize it with the other CNRS tools. Follow instructions in [Traveler's guide, before your travel (part 1)](../../../../downloads/TRAVELER-GUIDE_Before-the-mission_V1.1-1st-part.pdf), page 10.

2. You then submit this for approval to our Dept admins (by clicking on a button called the like of _transmettre_ or _envoyer_, see detailed instructions below) 

!!! warning
	Our admins are supposed to be notified automatically when you do this, but for obscure reasons it's often not the case. Do therefore send a ticket or email to estelle.petite or isabelle.gabet to let them know you've created a new _mission_ (possibly providing the mission number that is issued by notilus)

3. When you request is approved (you should get an automatic email about that), your _mission_ appears in a second application called Notilus ([https://esr-cnrs.notilus-inone.fr/#/Dashboard](https://esr-cnrs.notilus-inone.fr/#/Dashboard)). There, you will most notably be able to arrange your reservations (essentially, under tab _Voyage_, click on each step of your travel, and click on _réserver_)

4. This will automatically take you to a third app, called Goelett ([https://travel.goelett.com/](https://travel.goelett.com/), formally called rydoo in the picture above), which is essentially a train/plane/hotel reservation plateform. Book your tickets there (you'll go/confirm through several successive pages). 

5. When this is done, close Goelett, go back to Notilus (which you'll probably have kept open in a separate page), and click _transmettre_ which, again (I know), submits your reservation to our admins (who are supposed to check that your effective budget do not widely exceeds the estimated cost done at step 1).

!!! warning
	Depending on your reservation, there may be very short delay before our admins must confirm your trip (last-minute train tickets may require less than 30min between your reservation on Notilus, your transfering to our admins, and their confirmation click). So in practice, you may want to give them advance notice, or even walk to their office to make sure they are available to react quickly. 

When our admins approve this final stage, you're done. You should receive tickets and hotel voucher by email. 

The whole system is relatively convenient _when it works_ but (as of Jan. 2024) is extraordinarily brittle and counter-intuitive, so you're likely to mess up a couple of times because you get the gist of it. There's a process of continuous improvement which, hopefully, will make things better.
