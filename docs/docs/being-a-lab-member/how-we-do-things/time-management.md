# Time management

## Lab hours

The standard 7-hour work day in the department is 9:30am-5:30pm with a one hour break for lunch. 
You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night.

!!! warning
	The SUPMICROTECH building has official opening hours, after which doors will be locked and the alarm set. 
  
These are <mark> MON-FRI: from 7:30 am to 9 pm, SAT: from 8 am to 5 pm</mark>. If you request exceptional permission to enter the building outside of these hours (ex. you have a 5am zoom call with another country, and would like to do it in the lab), the access rights on your ID card can be modified temporarily, and the alarms turned off: ask Emeline Beluche <emeline.beluche@ens2m.fr>

## Week structure

You are generally free to organize your work during the week (i.e. what you do on what day, etc.) but we try to have a little structure in place so that lab members can know what to expect of each others:  

As of Sept. 2023, we are having lab meetings ([Café Neuro](../cafe-neuro/)) every Wednesday morning, ca. 10h30-12h. 

By default, lab members are expected to be in the lab everyday, unless otherwise agreed with their PI (see [below](#the-five-states-of-the-academic-employee), the "Five States of Academic Employees")

PI JJA attempts to be in the lab fulltime for discussions and impromptu questions on monday all day, wednesday morning, and friday all day. He will be in the Dept, but possibly working on his own or busy in dept meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. JJ is on work-at-home time every wednesday afternoons.  

PI Patrick Nectoux is in the lab Monday thru Thursday, and is on work-at-home time on Fridays. 

## Annual structure

Because FEMTO-ST is a non-teaching environment, and most of us in the team are full-time researchers, a year in the lab isn't typically structured in terms/semesters (as many labs in other countries are).

Our typical year starts in the last week of August, and lasts until mid-July. We keep our activity and lab meetings throughout the year, except during Christmas break (last 2 weeks of December), summer break (typically mid-July to end-August), and the occasional bank holiday.

There are 11 official bank holiday (_jour férié_) in France, on which the lab is closed and lab members are not expected to come to work (even though the premises may remain open for urgent matters - double check if you intend to come in on these days):

* New year's day (Jan 1st)
* Easter monday (one monday in April)
* Labour day (May 1st)
* Victory in Europe day (May 8th)
* Ascension day (one thursday in May)
* Whit Monday / Pentecôte (one monday in May)
* Bastille's day (July 14th)
* Assumption of Mary (Aug 15th)
* All saints' day (Nov 1st)
* Armistice day (Nov 11th)
* Christmas' day (dec 25th)

The lab has no mandatory vacation time, but our building closes down for one week every Christmas, and for 2 weeks in the first 2 weeks of August, so these are good times to plan vacations if you have any. If you want to keep working during these periods, you need to make arrangement to work from home.&#x20;

Because several faculty in the Dept. teach at ENSMM/Supmicrotech, and the ENSMM school year tends to align with the national school holidays (_vacances scolaires:_ vacances de Toussaint, 2 weeks end of October; vacances de Noel, 2 weeks end of Dec; vacances d'hiver, 2 weeks mid-February; vacances de Pâques/printemps, 2 weeks mid-April), you'll see the Dept. tend to get a little quiet on these periods. While many of us (incl. those with families) tend to align their own vacations with these periods, the lab will continue its normal operations throughout, albeit with maybe slightly less people around.&#x20;

## The Five States of the Academic Employee

If you are an employee in the academic sector (typically with us, if you have a work contract from CNRS, or perhaps one of the lab's other [tutelles](../../../about-the-lab/about-our-operating-institutions)), you have to abide to the employment rules of French civil service. These are relatively simple. Electrons have two possible states, we have five:  

On any given day, every lab member is: 

1. Either at work, in the lab, during normal working hours (by default)

2. Or, if not in the lab, in one of 4 "absent states" that each need to be systematically reported:
  - in holiday
  - on sick leave (or by extension maternity leave/compassionate leave)
  - on official travel (_mission_)
  - or in teletravail (remote/work-at-home)

Every absent state (holiday, sick leave, mission, teletravail) has to be reported at two places:

1. to your PI, typically via a Slack DM, with reasonable advance notice whenever possible, and
2. if you're a CNRS employee, in the CNRS AGATE-TEMPO plateform [https://agate-tempo.cnrs.fr](https://agate-tempo.cnrs.fr/fr/). (N.B. you need a CNRS/Janus id for this, which you only have if you're employed by CNRS. Other employers may have different plateforms)

Note that declaring your holiday in AGATE-TEMPO needs to be done _ahead_ of time, as they require validation by someone higher up (typically the head of dept) and they cannot be declared _after_ the day is passed

## Reporting leave of absence (holiday/sick leave)

### Annual leave/holiday

Your exact count of days of annual leave depends on your individual contract and employer but, in CNRS, it tends to be relatively high (8 weeks, or 40 days). How you use these days is up to you, but you have to inform your PI of when you take holidays with a reasonable notice (ex. rule of x4-6: one week ahead for one day, one month ahead for a week off, 4-6 months ahead for a month off) to help with project planning and lab organization.&#x20;

It is okay to take most of your annual leave at once, which may make sense e.g. if visiting family abroad.&#x20;

The lab has no mandatory vacation time, but our building closes down for one week every Christmas, and for 2 weeks in the first 2 weeks of August, so these are good times to plan vacations if you have any.

### Sick leave guidelines

If you're too sick to come to work, (1) inform your PI (typically via a Slack DM), (2) visit a doctor (GP, _médecin généraliste_) and ask for a sick leave certificate. You can then declare your sick leave on the CNRS HR plateform [https://ariane.cnrs.fr](https://ariane.cnrs.fr)

### Absent for Family reasons 

French law has a number of rules that gives you an automatic number of leave days in the event of happy or not-so-happy family situations. 

These are 
- 4 leave days for wedding or PACS (pacte civil de solidarité).
- 1 leave day if a child gets married.
- 3 leave days at the birth of your child. Note that you are also in this case entitled to a longer maternity/paternity leave
- 5 leave days (compassionate leave) for the death of a child, 3 days for the death of a partner, and immediate family (parents, siblings)

Of course, you may always complement these days with extra days from your annual leave count. 

As above, you can declare such leave on the CNRS HR plateform [https://ariane.cnrs.fr](https://ariane.cnrs.fr).
