# Important lab accounts

This page describes the minimal accounts that everyone should set up when they work in the neuro lab

## Slack

All of our lab communication goes through our dedicated Slack workspace ([https://neuro-group-femto.slack.com](https://neuro-group-femto.slack.com)), and not by email (see [communication.md](../being-a-lab-member/how-we-do-things/communication.md "mention") for more information on lab communication practices).&#x20;

Upon your arrival, but typically a few days/week before, JJ will typically have issued you a Slack invitation. If you haven't already, please create your Slack profile, with an easy-looking user name (easier to @jj than @jean-julien.aucouturier) and a recognizable profile picture.&#x20;

Slack can be accessed in the browser, but we recommend you install the client [https://slack.com/intl/fr-fr/downloads](https://slack.com/intl/fr-fr/downloads) which makes it easier to get notifications, etc. There are also a variety of Android/MacOS apps, which you can install on your personal phone if you like. 

Then read our [Using Slack](../../being-a-lab-member/how-we-do-things/using-slack/) page. 

## Github

All of our research projects are hosted on our github organization page: [https://github.com/neuro-team-femto](https://github.com/neuro-team-femto), so it's important that you get access & incorporate git in your workflow.&#x20;

* get a (free) github account if you don't already have one ([https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join))
* send your github account to jj so he can invite you to the neuro-team-femto organization; upon the invitation, you'll get a notification to join in your github dashboard, which you'll have to accept.&#x20;
* get your computer set up with git: if you're a command-line person, you can simply install the git CL tool [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads); if you like GUI better, you can install a variety of clients [https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) - some of us have used the Github client in particular [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
