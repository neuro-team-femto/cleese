# Before you arrive: ZRR application

The FEMTO-ST Institute is classified as a [_Zone à Régime Restrictif_](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_%C3%A0_r%C3%A9gime_restrictif) (ZRR). Every incoming employee is required to have a background check before they can enter the building (and, in many cases, before they can be issued a contract). 

Before they join the lab, new lab members must therefore complete a ZRR application: 

- download application form [here](../downloads/ZRR_form.xlsm)
- fill in your personal information (frame #1)
- ask your PI to fill in red frame #2 (_"activities to be pursued in the ZRR"_)
- create a single .pdf file containing the following information: 
	- a detailed description of your job position (if you're a PhD student, this will typically be a copy of the announcement for your position. Ask your PI when in doubt)
	- a copy of your ID or passport
	- a full resume indicating degrees and work experience, esp. experiences abroad with dates of stay
	- a proof of funding for the position (could be your contract, your letter of invitation + ask your PI for a proof of funding if you're funded on one of the lab's grants)
- download the confidentiality agreement (_engagement de confidentialité_) [here](../downloads/Engagement_confidentialité.docx), fill it with your name, sign it and save as pdf. 

The complete application (form + supporting documents + confidentiality agreement) should be sent to your PI for verification, and he/she will then send it to our Dept admins, who will make the final submission. ZRR applications are processed centrally at the French Ministry of Research and Higher education. It takes between 6-8 weeks for a decision to be returned to us (if we hear nothing back after 8 weeks, the application is considered approved). The decision will be returned by email to your PI, who will in turn inform you of the results. 

!!! warning "Important"

    ZRR applications take between 6-8 weeks to be processed. As a successful ZRR application is in many cases compulsory for your contract to be issued, it is therefore important to do this step well in advance of your contract starting date. In addition, although such decisions are rare and can be appealed in some cases, a declined ZRR application is bad news: it typically means we won't be able to issue you a contract, or even host you in the lab. So, if timing permits, you may want to wait for your approved ZRR application before e.g. paying Visa fees, booking tickets or incurring any costs (e.g. moving) because we wouldn't be able to reimburse theses costs if your ZRR application is declined.
