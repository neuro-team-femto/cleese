# Why we use a lab manual

## "The key to a happy lab life is in the manual"

	_"A well-crafted set of guidelines and advice can save time, reassure trainees and promote a positive lab culture"_.

The purpose of this manual is to gather basic information about the lab and the procedures we follow. 

One benefit for this document is to act as collective wisdom on how to run the many aspects of being a member of the lab. Lab members, old and new, should not have to struggle to find answers to commonly asked questions. This includes questions about the local academic environment, guiding what registration(s) one needs to do on their first day/week, using the lab's computer services and more generally documenting how we do things such as our internal communication, meetings, time management, etc. The manual is not only intended as a first point of reference for new lab members who join the group, but also, for everyone, to document the common conventions and procedures that we have established and to be a basis to propose improvements to this workflow as new, better methods become available.

Another benefit of this document is to clarify our roles and expectations. We are an interdisciplinary, multicultural group with a big variety of backgrounds and academic experience, and it is sometimes unclear what is generally expected of a member in a lab such as ours, as well as what one can expect from the PI. While this document is intended to represent the PI's vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing FEMTO-ST, CNRS and University policies (which take precedence), everything in here can be discussed: our goal is to foster an environment of consistent scientific excellence and personal development that supports every lab member in reaching their full potential, and helps us have fun while doing great science. 

!!! warning "Important"

	Upon joining the lab, all lab members are required to read the lab manual. We expect that more information will be added and some sections will be revised as the lab grows and develops. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents of this manual, see [this page](how-to-update-the-manual.md)
