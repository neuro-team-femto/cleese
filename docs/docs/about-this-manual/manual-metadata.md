This manual was created by JJ Aucouturier in Sept. 2023, and is since then receiving contributions from several lab members. 

Writing this manual was inspired by Twitter/X conversations by Prof. Sam Mehr (ex-Harvard music lab) and Prof. [Mariam Aly](https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/mariam-aly), about the benefits of lab manuals/handbooks, a conversation which lead to assembling [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LqGdtHg0dMbj9lsCnC1QOoWzIsnSNRTSek6i3Kls2Ik/edit) of freely shared manuals from a variety of psych/neuro labs. Its specific content was in some places adapted from existing manuals from the [Peelle lab](http://jpeelle.net/peellelab_manual.pdf), [Aly lab](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) and [Music Lab](https://handbook-public.themusiclab.org/) manuals, and we thank them for sharing. 

This manual is written in the [materials for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) framework (Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2023 Martin Donath). 

The idea to name the manual after some fictionary assistant is credited to [Corentin Bernard](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=WPYER6YAAAAJ&hl=en) (who suggested we named it Alfred after Batman's butler, another fine idea TBH).
