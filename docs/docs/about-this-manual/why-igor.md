# Why Igor ? 

<img style="float: left;" src="../../images/igor.png"; width=20%;>This manual was created by JJ Aucouturier in Sept. 2023, in the attempt to gather basic information about the lab and the procedures we follow. In the anglo-saxon academic system, many labs may hire laboratory assistants who soon become the living memory of the team, help orientate new members, run studies and make sure things generally run smoothly. In French academia however, we have no such system, but instead rely on heroic admins who operate such support functions for typically 50-100 people, and who clearly don't have the time or bandwidth to specialize in any lab procedure specifically. 

We were jealous. 

So instead, in pure [Hammer film tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_(character)), we mad-brain-scientists thought we'd just create our own little hunchback lab assistant. Behold Igor, named after a long tradition of assistants to the likes of Dr Frankenstein. Igor may not get you fresh brains, but will crack most other problems you may have with how the lab operates.
