# Welcome !

<img style="float: left;" src="images/igor.png"; width=20%;> This is the lab manual for the [FEMTO Neuro Group](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io) (hereafter "the lab"), a research group of the Dept. of Automation and Robotics, FEMTO-ST Institute in Besan√ßon, France. 

This document works a bit like our own little hunchback lab assistant - so much, in fact, that we decided to call him [Igor](about-this-manual/why-igor.md).  

Igor's purpose in life is to gather basic information about the lab and the procedures we follow. He is not only intended as a first point of reference for new lab members who join the group, but also, for everyone, as a way to document the common conventions and procedures that we have established and to be a basis to propose improvements to this workflow as new, better methods become available.

Igor likes brains. We like Igor.
