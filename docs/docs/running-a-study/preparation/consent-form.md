# Ethics & consent form

## Ethics

It is compulsory that every study we're running, regardless of how small (i.e. a simple behavioural test), should be associated with a preliminary ethical check and approval. Such approval is to be submitted to an external ethical committee (Institutional Review Board), which in France are either called _Comité Ethique_ or _Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP)_ depending on, roughly, whether the research includes healthy participants or patients. 

Until 2024 or so, we have been relying for our studies on agreements obtained from the INSEAD/Sorbonne University IRB for studies run in the [CREAM](../../../about-the-lab/lab-history) team. Check with your PI if your study falls within this scope. 

As of 2024, it is likely that your study needs a formal new application. 

!!! warning
	Ethical applications take time (up to 2-3 months for an IRB, up to 6-12months for a CPP) so planning is absolutely essential.  

## Consent form

Every participant in our study should be given enough information about the study's objectives and potential constraints/benefits prior to their participation, so that they can give their informed consent to participate, in the written form. 

If participants are paid for their participation (which is usually the case, at the rate of ~15€ per hour), then we should also collect a written receipt with their signature. 

[Here](../../downloads/consent_form_template.docx)'s a template consent-form to print out. It contains 4 pages meant to be printed on 2 double-sided sheets: 
1. information
2. consent form with experimenter's signature for participant to keep
3. consent form with participant's signature for us to keep
4. receipt with participant's signature
Pages 3&4 are to be kept and archived after the study. 

!!! warning
	Update the form with your specific information before printing, of course !
