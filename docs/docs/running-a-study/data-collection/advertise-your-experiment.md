# Finding participants


## Prepare a sticker for the roll-ups

We have 2 roll-ups: you should print a A3 sticker describing your experiment for each, and display them. 

Download [powerpoint template](../../downloads/A3_sticker.pptx) for A3 sticker.

Several places: 

- ENSMM entrance hall (gets you 5-10 people each time)

- never tried : FEMTO entrance hall

- post a A3 poster in AS2M cafeteria & ENSMM foyer


## Send email 

- send email to as2m@listes.femto-st.fr for local recruitment. Gets you 1-5 people. 

- send email to communication@ens2m.fr (to [Solenne Ricochon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/solenne-ricochon-150270105/?originalSubdomain=fr)) so they send an email announcement to the ENSMM students + an Instagram story on the ENSMM instagram (you can use [this](../../downloads/participate.jpg) visual). Gets you 10-20 people each time. 

- never tried : send email to steeven.flores@univ-fcomte.fr (Steeven Flores, community manager for ISIFC), so he can post on the ISIFC student discord as well as on TV screens (you can use [this](../../downloads/participate.jpg) visual). Remember ISIFC students have no access card to the supmicrotech building, so you should give instructions and e.g. organize for someone to escort them from the entrance.
