# Steps to do when you've published a preprint or a paper


## Update the neuro-group website

https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/publications/


## fill a new entry in publiweb

- fill in this excel sheet with the article information

- send form & pdf author's copy of the article to Estelle Petite

- normally the entry gets automatically published in publiweb (e.g. in your FEMTO profile page) + in HAL a few days later
