CLEESE is a free, standalone Python module, distributed under an open-source MIT Licence on the FEMTO Neuro team github page. 

It was originally designed in 2018 by Juan José Burred, Emmanuel Ponsot and Jean-Julien Aucouturier at STMS Lab (IRCAM/CNRS/Sorbonne Université, Paris - France), and released on the IRCAM Forumnet plateform. As of 2021, CLEESE is maintained by the FEMTO Neuro Team at the FEMTO-ST Institute (CNRS/Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté) in Besançon - France, and distributed by the team's github page. 

CLEESE development was originally funded by the European Research Council (CREAM 335536, 2014-2019, PI: JJ Aucouturier), and has since then received support from Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR SEPIA, AND Sounds4Coma), Fondation pour l'Audition (DASHES) and Région Bourgogne-Franche Comté (ASPECT).
