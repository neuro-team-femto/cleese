# Lab philosophy/values

It's always hard to pinpoint what our specific values are, and these may be slowly changing/reaffirming over time, but over the years here are a few things we have come to deem important and foundational to how we work. We may not always deliver perfectly on all of these values, but we are committed to evaluating our work upon these standards, and are happy to be (kindly) called out when we fall short. 

## Open-science

	_"Public money ? Public data !"_

Because our research is almost entirely publicly funded, and because all our permanent and non-permanent lab members are civil servants part of the public sector, we believe it is a moral commitment to make our results accessible for free at all levels of society. This includes publications (open-access) but also research material, stimuli, data, and software. 

This manual and our lab website, both being posted on github and therefore available for anyone to fork and re-use, are both an example, and a consequence of this. On the one hand, this manual uses the [materials for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) open-source framework, and is hosted as a repository on the lab's [github page](https://github.com/neuro-team-femto); the lab website uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) open-source static site renderer, and is also hosted as a repository on the lab's github. On the other hand, this manual was inspired by a number of documents [shared openly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LqGdtHg0dMbj9lsCnC1QOoWzIsnSNRTSek6i3Kls2Ik/edit) by other labs, and we thank them for this. The website is forked and adapted from the excellent [Kording lab](https://kordinglab.com/) at University of Pennsylvania. 

## Mechanistic biological science

!!! quote

	_"By manipulating the system, the investigators transform their study from merely descriptive to hypothesis driven"_ (Casadevall & Fang, [Infection & Immunity, 2008](../downloads/casadevalldescriptive.pdf))

Even if our research uses techniques borrowed and extended from signal processing, control engineering and dynamical system modeling, our research remains of a fundamentally biological nature: our object of study is the human brain, and we believe in the value of using the methods of the experimental natural sciences to generate novel mechanistic insights into how it works (in health) or doesn't (in disease). 

The adjective _mechanistic_ has a deep-rooted meaning in experimental biology, and is basically related to opposing descriptive correlational data with experiments in which we causally _manipulate_ parts of the system to test if it reacts in some predicted direction. This [editorial](../downloads/casadevalldescriptive.pdf) by molecular biologists Casadevall & Fang is an excellent short piece on why this matters. For a concrete example of how we apply this value into our work, see e.g. how _Study 5_ contributes causal evidence to the correlational data of _Study 1-4_ in Aucouturier & Canonne, [2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027717300276#s0085)

## Interdisciplinarity

!!! quote

	_"There is nothing so practical as a good theory."_ - Lewin, 1951

	_"There is nothing so theoretical as a good method."_ - Greenwald, [Perspectives on Psychological Science 2012](https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/528Readings/Greenwald2012.pdf)


Our research work is deeply interdisciplinary, combining approaches from signal processing, control engineering and dynamical system modeling (i.e., roughly defined information science and engineering science) and human cognitive neuroscience and clinical sensory electrophysiology. 

This has several important consequences: 

- respect: everybody here is bound to have a specific background (PI JJA's is audio signal processing), and to be lacking in other dimensions. Some of our lab members were trained in engineering and computational approaches, with an appetite for neuroscience; others were trained in neuroscience and cognitive science, with an appetite for computational methods; other may be trained in clinical practice, and get to learn how to do research. Everything is fine, provided we maintain a respectful and reflexive attitude to collaborative work. 

- reflexivity: exploring the interface between very different domains (namely, control and neuroscience) means there often are no predefined methodologies, or best practices, on how to use control approaches to make valid scientific proof in the natural sciences. It is therefore an important value in our work to be reflexive and even a little bit epistemological, i.e. to value questioning the type of biological claims one can make from our new tools. 

For French readers, JJ's 2017 [Habilitation report](https://hal.science/tel-01970959) (a not-so-long read, at 60 pages) is an autobiographical account of that type of interdisciplinary thinking (also: [video](https://medias.ircam.fr/x26c484) recording). For English readers, earlier papers such as [JIIS 2013](https://hal.science/hal-01546752v1/file/Aucouturier%26Bigand%20-%20JIIS.pdf) and [ISMIR 2012](https://ismir2012.ismir.net/authors/event/papers/397_ISMIR_2012.pdf), while a bit dated, touch a bit on the same questions.   


## People over results #mentorfirst

!!! quote
	_"We believe that prioritizing the needs of researchers and focusing on providing high-quality mentorship leads to greater creativity, and ultimately productivity, in our research programs"_ - Jen Heemstra, [#mentorfirst](https://mentorfirst.org/)

Many of us have been in labs before which prioritized results over people - these labs typically shine when evaluated on high-impact journal publications, and the sheer quantity of work produced every year; sometimes though, it's unclear how well their alumni fare in their subsequent careers, and how much of a positive relation one manages to keep when they leave the lab - or even while in the lab proper. 

This may sound hackneyed, but in the Neuro group, we believe our main societal output is scientists, and not science. Our thinking goes like this: all of our work and infrastructure is funded by public money, and we want to optimize the return on investment for society. For all the amazing research productivity one may have in the 1-to-3 years they're likely to stay with us, this is nothing compared to the societal impact a well-trained, ethical, reflexive scientist will have for the many years they'll spend _without us_ in the rest of their careers. 

Our lab has taken the [#mentorfirst](https://mentorfirst.org/) pledge. We wish to be evaluated in how well our trainees fare in their subsequent careers, and take our greatest pride in the growing network of all our alumni and friends (see [here](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/people/), and [there](https://neuro-team-femto.github.io/cream/)).
