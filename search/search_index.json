There are about 800 different UMRs in France, which all have a name and number. The FEMTO-ST Institute is UMR 6174.  </p> <p>The reason UMRs are called \"mixed\" is that they are typically co-operated by several different institutions. In our case, the FEMTO-ST Institute is co-operated by Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9(UFC), l'Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure de M\u00e9canique et des Microtechniques(SUPMICROTECH) and l'Universit\u00e9 de Technologie de Belfort-Montb\u00e9liard (UTBM). In French, such co-operating institutions are called the tutelles (or co-tutelles) of the UMR. </p> <p>Affiliations in papers</p> <p>This co-tutelle situation is reflected in how we should affiliate ourselves in research papers:  Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9, SUPMICROTECH, CNRS, institut FEMTO-ST, F-25000 Besan\u00e7on, France</p>"},{"location":"about-the-lab/about-our-operating-institutions/#getting-stuff-done-in-umrs","title":"Getting stuff done in UMRs","text":"<p>It is important to understand that, while UMRs are the main building blocks of French academia, they are purely administrative units which have no financial or legal existence: UMRs cannot hire personnel, issue contracts, invoice or get paid by other entities, nor be held responsible legally. All of these operations rather involve the tutelles of the UMRs. In practice, this means that nobody in the lab are employees of the FEMTO-ST Institute (which has no legal right to employ anyone), but can only be employed by one of its tutelles (CNRS, UFC, SUPMICROTECH or UTBM). Similarly, our research budget is never hosted at FEMTO-ST: it resides in budget lines in either CNRS, UFC, SUPMICROTECH or UTBM. Whenever we sign a contract, research or internship agreement, the signatory is not FEMTO-ST, but again one of CNRS, UFC, SUPMICROTECH or UTBM. </p> <p>This has several consequences in practice: </p> <ul> <li> <p>you could find yourself in a room where 4 people work together on a research project, and all rightful members of the FEMTO-ST Institute, despite being employed by four different institutions (ex. one may be a charg\u00e9 de recherche CNRS, another a ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rence SUPMICROTECH) - confusingly often with different job titles and even different pay scales (also most of these have been largely uniformized in recent years, a trend perhaps driven by this UMR organization).</p> </li> <li> <p>administrative rules as to e.g. where and how to buy stuff, how to handle research budget, travel costs, etc. are all tutelle-dependant, and may therefore differ based on where the corresponding budget is handled. For instance, while it may be impossible to buy a computer at the local shop in research budget handled at CNRS (because e.g. CNRS has a country-wide agreement to only use a designed seller), it may be possible to do so if your research budget is handled at e.g. SUPMICROTECH (which may not have such a requirement). </p> </li> <li> <p>depending on the tutelle in charge, some of the admin services handling your research procedures may be on-site (ex. administrative services for SUPMICROTECH are in the same building), others in other parts of the campus (e.g. UFC), others in other parts of the country. For instance, CNRS procedures from the lab are all handled regionally, in the D\u00e9l\u00e9gation R\u00e9gionale Centre-Est in Nancy, but luckily involve a lot of remote/web services (see list here). </p> </li> </ul> <p>While this sounds complicated, there are several advantages to such an organization: </p> <ul> <li> <p>all UMR personnel, regardless of which tutelle is their employer, are entitled to services by all the other tutelles. In our case, this is reflected in how e.g. our group occupies lab space in the SUPMICROTECH building (despite most of us being employed by CNRS) without needing to e.g. rent space as is sometimes seen in ango-saxon academia; and how upon joining the lab one has access to web accounts and services operated by all tutelles (see lab registration procedure here).</p> </li> <li> <p>our heroic department admins (Isabelle Gabet and Estelle Petite) act a one-stop shop to interface with all tutelle services, and most insulate us from all this complexity. For most of our administrative processes they will typically be the only persons you get to talk to, and they will relay the request (or, sometimes, direct you) to the person in charge in the central services of whatever tutelle is involved. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>In case of CNRS procedures, Isabelle and Estelle will relay the request (or direct you) to the regional CNRS services of D\u00e9l\u00e9gation R\u00e9gionale Centre-Est in Nancy. As a rule of thumb, every request should first go to Isabelle and Estelle, never directly to staff at D\u00e9l\u00e9gation R\u00e9gionale (who typically manage a portfolio of 10-20 labs each, including FEMTO-ST). In the rare cases where you need to interact to someone in Nancy, Isabelle or Estelle will let you know exactly whom to contact and how.  </p> <p>All this still means one has to mentally juggle the different opportunities and constraints entailed by managing work in one or another tutelle. In practice, because both Neuro group PIs JJA and PN are formally CNRS employees, we tend to manage most, if not all, of our research procedures so that they are handled by CNRS. This means that typical lab members will be hired by CNRS (i.e. CNRS is signatory on their work contract), and our typical expenses and travel will be paid from grant money that's managed by CNRS. Much of the procedures described in this manual therefore correspond to CNRS practices, and may not apply to e.g. other teams in the department or the institute who may be operated with other preferred tutelles.</p>"},{"location":"about-the-lab/about-our-operating-institutions/#about-our-cnrs-tutelle","title":"About our CNRS tutelle","text":"<p>The French National Centre for Scientific Research (French: Centre national de la recherche scientifique, CNRS) is the largest French state research organisation (formally, an \u00c9tablissement public \u00e0 caract\u00e8re scientifique et technologique, or EPST) and the largest fundamental science agency in Europe. </p> <p>It employs more than 30,000 staff, including ca. 12,000 tenured researchers, 13,000 engineers and technical staff, and 8,000 contractual workers.

Large labs, like FEMTO, sometimes call themselves Institutes, and may be organized in Departments (as we are here), but they are still formally \"labs\".

Slack only works if we know all the information is there, and nowhere else. Don't send information to other lab members or your PI(s) by email. If you need to transfer information from a specific email, or are responding to email conversations including both lab members and external collaborators who are not on slack, please also send a quick notification on slack, and consider copying important information and files directly to slack too.  </p> </li> <li> <p>default language on Slack is English. If you're a French speaker, please use French only in DMs with other French speakers, or in specific project channels where it is absolutely certain that no one involve will ever not be a French speaker. Be respectuful of the future lab member who may be taking on part of your project in 6 months, and may not be a French speaker.  </p> </li> <li> <p>every conversation should occur in a public channel: while one may think that discussing a minor point of their research project is not of public interest to the rest of the group, and may be tempted to do it in private direct messages - refrain: first, you never know whether that is the case, and you may often find that someone may chime in with the relevant expertise even though you didn't think they could. Second, maintaining all conversation public also helps creating collective mindspace: even if one doesn't take part in all parallel conversations, we know that these are happening. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Exceptions</p> <p>The only exception to posting publicly is, of course, confidential information about HR, leave of absence, etc. and anything contract related. Please contact your PI directly with direct message about these. For longer conversations that you want to keep private (e.g. apply to a competitive position), you can also create a private channel. </p> <ul> <li> <p>create dedicated channels liberally: the rule of thumb is to create and use one dedicated channel per project (see below), but channels can also be created adhoc to discuss e.g. who's going to a specific conference, etc.  Don't spam the #general channel for specific project communication. Also, try not to bury information about one project into another project's channel. You can have as many active channels as you have projects. </p> </li> <li> <p>Upon creating a new channel, include the relevant people and post a brief message about what the channel is about. When they are not used, channels can be archived so they can still be searched. </p> </li> <li> <p>use the #general channel for common interest announcements, a bit like a mailing list. Don't spam it with specific project conversation (rule of thumb: if you're tagging a single person in your message, this probaby shouldn't go to #general), but it's totally ok to use it for sending e.g. a polite note to let people know you'll be late to the lab on a certain day, etc. </p> </li> <li> <p>familiarize yourself with notifications/channel follows: while everything is by default public, Slack is replete with options to e.g. get only notified of certain categories of messages, or follow and stop following certain channels as your work may need. Take some time to optimize what information you're getting. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Slack and work-life balance</p> <p>Because we don't use email for internal communication among lab members, we tend to use Slack as both a synchronous (e.g. to chat in real-time) and asynchronous (e.g. post an idea, a request, share a paper...) means of communication.

For practicality, let's call all this package of work a \"project\". </p> <p>By rule, every new project should get : </p> <ol> <li>its dedicated slack channel</li> <li>its dedicated repo on the lab's github</li> </ol> <p>Warning</p> <p>By rule, every project should have PI approval - so, basically, involve your PI in deciding whether to launch a new slack/repo project space. </p> <p>Both channel and repo should have the same name (sometimes the first thing we should talk about is decide on how we call the channel and repo). All information/discussion about that project goes to that channel, and all code regarding the project's experiment design and data analysis should go to that repo. </p> <p>In addition, channels and repo should be linked using the <code>/github</code> bot. Type  <code>/github subscribe [repository_name]</code> in the repository_name channel in Slack, and the channel will automatically post updates about e.g. commits, PRs, etc. occurring in the repo. </p> <p>Hint</p> <p>If you make any change to the lab_manual, i.e. to the lab_manual repo in github, you'll see automatic notifications in the lab_manual channel in Slack. That's because the lab_manual channel was subscribed to the corresponding repo in github, in the same way project channel should be. </p> <p>Because this cycle of design + data-collection + analysis + writing can be quite long, we expect the typical active life of a project channel would be about ~1 year.

You do not have to be in 9:30am-5:30pm every day but do show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done.

Turn off the lights if you\u2019re the last one leaving for the day. </p> </li> <li> <p>Keep the lab tidy. Eating in lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dress code is casual but not too casual.
